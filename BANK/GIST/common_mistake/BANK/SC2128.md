## Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element.

### Problematic code:

    myarray=(foo bar)
    for f in $myarray
    do
      cat "$f"
    done

### Correct code:

    myarray=(foo bar)
    for f in "${myarray[@]}"
    do
      cat "$f"
    done

### Rationale:

When referencing arrays, `$myarray` is equivalent to `${myarray[0]}` -- it results in only the first of multiple elements.

To get all elements as separate parameters, use the index `@` (and make sure to double quote). In the example, `echo "${myarray[@]}"` is equivalent to `echo "foo" "bar"`.

To get all elements as a single parameter, concatenated by the first character in `IFS`, use the index `*`. In the example, `echo "${myarray[*]}"` is equivalent to `echo "foo bar"`.
