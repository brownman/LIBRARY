## >= is not a valid operator. Use '! a < b' instead.

### Problematic code:

    [[ a &lt;= b ]]

### Correct code:

    [[ ! a > b ]]

### Rationale:

The operators `<=` and `>=` are not supported by Bourne shells. Instead of "less than or equal", rewrite as "not greater than". 

### Contraindications

None
