##  -e doesn't work with globs. Use a for loop.

### Problematic code:

    if [ -e dir/*.mp3 ]
    then
      echo "There are mp3 files."
    fi

### Correct code:

    for file in dir/*.mp3
    do
      if [ -e "$file" ]
      then
        echo "There are mp3 files"
        break
      fi
    done

### Rationale:

`[ -e file* ]` only works if there's 0 or 1 matches. If there are multiple, it becomes `[ -e file1 file2 ]`, and the test fails. 

`[[ -e file* ]]` doesn't work at all.

Instead, use a for loop to expand the glob and check each result individually.

### Contraindications

None.
