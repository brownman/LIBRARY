## Aliases can't use positional parameters. Use a function.

### Problematic code:

    alias archive='mv "$@" /backup'

### Correct code:

    archive() { mv "$@" /backup; }
    

### Rationale:

Aliases just substitute the start of a command with something else. They therefore can't use positional parameters, such as `$1`. Rewrite your alias as a function.

### Contraindications

None.
