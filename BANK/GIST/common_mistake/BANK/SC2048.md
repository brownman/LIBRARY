## Use "$@" (with quotes) to prevent whitespace problems.

### Problematic code:

    cp $* ~/dir

### Correct code:

    cp "$@" ~/dir

### Rationale:

`$*`, unquoted, is subject to word splitting and globbing.

Let's say you have three arguments: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`"$@"` will expand into exactly that: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`$*` will expand into multiple other arguments: `baz`, `foo`, `bar`, `file.txt` and `otherfile.jpg`

Since the latter is rarely expected or desired, ShellCheck warns about it.

### Contraindications

None.
