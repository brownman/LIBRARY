## Use semicolon or linefeed before 'done' (or quote to make it literal).

### Problematic code:

    for f in *; do echo "$f" done

### Correct code:

    for f in *; do echo "$f"; done

### Rationale:

`done` only works as a keyword when it's the first token of the command. If added after a command, it will just be the literal word "done". 

### Contraindications

If you're intentionally using `done` as a literal, you can quote it to make this clear to shellcheck and human readers, e.g. instead of `echo Task is done`, use `echo "Task is done"`.
