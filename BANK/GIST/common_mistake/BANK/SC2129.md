## Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file instead of individual redirects.

### Problematic code:

    echo foo >> file
    date >> file
    cat stuff  >> file
    

### Correct code:

    { 
      echo foo
      date
      cat stuff
    } >> file

### Rationale:

Rather than adding `>> something` after every single line, you can simply group the relevant commands and redirect the group.

### Contraindications

This is mainly a stylistic issue, and can freely be ignored.
