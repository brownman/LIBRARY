## Since you double quoted this, it will not word split, and the loop will only run once.

### Problematic code:

    for s in "$(mycommand)"; do echo "$s"; done

### Correct code:

The correct code depends on your intention. Let's say you're in a directory with the files `file.png` and `My cat.png`, and you want to loop over a command that outputs (or variable that contains):

    hello world
    My *.png

#### Loop over each line without globbing (`hello world`, `My *.png`)

    mycommand | while IFS= read -r s; do echo "$s"; done

#### Loop over each word with globbing (`hello`, `world`, `My`, `file.png`, `My cat.png`):

    # relies on the fact that IFS by default contains space-tab-linefeed
    for s in $(mycommand); do echo "$s"; done 

#### Loop over each line with globbing (`hello world`, `My cat.png`)

    # explicitly set IFS to contain only a line feed
    IFS='
    ' 
    for s in $(mycommand); do echo "$s"; done 

### Rationale:

You get this warning because you have a loop that will only ever run exactly one iteration. Since you have a loop, you clearly expect it to run more than once. You just have to decide how it should be split up.

### Contraindications

None.
