## Consider using grep -c instead of grep|wc.

### Problematic code:

    grep foo | wc -l

### Correct code:

    grep -c foo

### Rationale:

This is purely a stylistic issue. `grep` can count lines without piping to `wc`. 

Note that in many cases, this number is only used to see whether there are matches (i.e. `> 0`). In these cases, it's better and more efficient to use `grep -q` and check its exit status:

    if grep -q pattern file
    then
      echo "The file contains the pattern"
    fi

### Contraindications

If you e.g. want to count characters instead of lines, and you actually care about the number and not just whether it's greater than 0.
