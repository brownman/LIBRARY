# To read lines rather than words, pipe/redirect to a 'while read' loop.

### Problematic code:

    for line in $(cat file | grep -v '^ *#')
    do
      echo "Line: $line"
    done

### Correct code:

    grep -v '^ *#' < file | while IFS= read -r line
    do
      echo "Line: $line"
    done

or without a subshell (bash, zsh, ksh):

    while IFS= read -r line
    do
      echo "Line: $line"
    done < <(grep -v '^ *#' < file)

### Rationale:

For loops by default (subject to `$IFS`) read word by word. Additionally, glob expansion will occur.

Given this text file:

    foo *
    bar

The for loop will print:

    Line: foo
    Line: aardwark.jpg
    Line: bullfrog.jpg
    ...

The while loop will print:

    Line: foo *
    Line: bar


### Contraindications

If you want to read word by word, you should still use a while read loop (e.g. with `read -a` to read words into an array).

Rare reasons for ignoring this message is if you don't care because your file only contains numbers and you're not interested in good practices, or if you've set `$IFS` appropriately and also disabled globbing.
