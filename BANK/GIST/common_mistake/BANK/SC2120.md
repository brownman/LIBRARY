# foo references arguments, but none are ever passed.

### Problematic code:

    sayhello() {
      echo "Hello $1"
    }
    sayhello

`./myscript World` just prints "Hello " instead of "Hello World".

### Correct code:

    sayhello() {
      echo "Hello $1"
    }
    sayhello "$@"

`./myscript World` now prints "Hello World".

### Rationale:

In a function, `$1` and up refers to the function's parameters, not the script's parameters.

If you want to process your script's parameters in a function, you have to explicitly pass them. You can do this with `myfunction "$@"`. 

Note that `"$@"` refers to the current context's positional parameters, so if you call a function from a function, you have to pass in `"$@"` to both of them:

    first() { second "$@"; }
    second() { echo "The first script parameter is: $1"; }
    first "$@"

### Contraindications

If the parameters are optional and you currently just don't want to use them, you can ignore this message.
