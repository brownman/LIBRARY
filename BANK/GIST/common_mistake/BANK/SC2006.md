# Use $(..) instead of deprecated \`..\` 

### Problematic code:

    echo "Current time: `date`"

### Correct code:

    echo "Current time: $(date)"

### Rationale:

Backtick command substitution `` `..` `` is legacy syntax with several problems.

1. It has a series of undefined behaviors related to quoting in POSIX.
1. It imposes a custom escaping mode with surprising results.
1. It's exceptionally hard to nest. 

`$(..)` command substitution has none of these problems, and is therefore strongly encouraged.

### Contraindications

None.
