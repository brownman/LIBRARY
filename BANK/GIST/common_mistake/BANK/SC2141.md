## Did you mean IFS=$'\t' ?

### Problematic code:

    IFS="\t"

### Correct code:

    IFS=$'\t'

### Rationale:

`IFS="\t"` splits on backslash and the letter "t". `IFS=$'\t'` splits on tab.

### Contraindications

It's extremely rare to want to split on the letter "n" or "t", rather than linefeed or tab.
