## Add double quotes around ${@}, otherwise it's just like $* and breaks on spaces.

### Problematic code:

    cp $@ ~/dir

### Correct code:

    cp "$@" ~/dir

### Rationale:

Double quotes around `$@` prevents globbing and word splitting while still expanding to multiple separate arguments.

Let's say you have three arguments: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`"$@"` will expand into exactly that: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`$@` will expand into multiple other arguments: `baz`, `foo`, `bar`, `file.txt` and `otherfile.jpg`

Since the latter is rarely expected or desired, ShellCheck warns about it.

### Contraindications

None.
