# Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that.

### Problematic code:

    name=World
    echo 'Hello $name'

### Correct code:

    name=World
    echo "Hello $name"

### Rationale:

Single quotes prevent expansion of everything, including variables and command substitution.

If you want to use the values of variables and such, use double quotes instead.

### Contraindications

If you want `$stuff` to be a literal dollar sign followed by the characters "stuff", you can ignore this message. 

ShellCheck tries to be smart about it, and won't warn when this is used with awk, perl and similar, but there are some inherent ambiguities like `'I have $1 in my wallet'`, which could be "one dollar" or "whatever's in the first parameter".
