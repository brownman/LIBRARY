## You need a space here

### Problematic code:

    if ![-z foo ]; then true; fi

### Correct code:

    if ! [ -z foo ]; then true; fi

### Rationale:

Bourne shells are very whitespace sensitive. Adding or removing spaces can drastically alter the meaning of a script. In these cases, ShellCheck has noticed that you're missing a space at the position indicated.

### Contraindications

None.
