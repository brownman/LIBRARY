## This \c will be a regular 'c' in this context.

### Problematic code:

    echo Yay \o/

or

    \git status

### Correct code:

    echo 'Yay \o/'

or

    command git status

### Rationale:

Escaping something that doesn't need escaping sometimes indicates a bug.

If the backslash was supposed to be literal, single quote it.

If the purpose is to run an external command rather than an alias, prefer `command`. 

### Contraindications

If you have an alias and a function (as opposed to an external command), you can either ignore this message or use `"name"` instead of `\name` to quiet ShellCheck.
