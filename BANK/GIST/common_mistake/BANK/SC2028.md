# echo won't expand escape sequences. Consider printf. 

### Problematic code:

    echo "Name:\t$value"

### Correct code:

    printf "Name:\t%s\n" "$value"

### Rationale:

Backslash escapes like `\t` and `\n` are not expanded by echo, and become literal backslash-t, backslash-n. 

`printf` does expand these sequences, and should be used instead.

Other, non-portable methods include `echo -e '\t'` and `echo $'\t'`. ShellCheck will warn if this is used in a script with shebang `#!/bin/sh`.

If you actually wanted a literal backslash-t, use 

    echo "\\t"
