# Consider using ( subshell ), 'cd foo||exit', or pushd/popd instead.

### Problematic code:

    for dir in */
    do
      cd "$dir"
      convert index.png index.jpg
      cd ..
    done


### Correct code:

    for dir in */
    do
      (
      cd "$dir" || exit
      convert index.png index.jpg
      )
    done

or

    for dir in */
    do
      cd "$dir" || continue
      convert index.png index.jpg
      cd ..
    done

### Rationale:

When doing `cd dir; somestuff; cd ..`, `cd dir` can fail when permissions are lacking, if the dir was deleted, or if `dir` is actually a file. 

In this case, `somestuff` will run in the wrong directory and `cd ..` will take you to an even more wrong directory. In a loop, this will likely cause the next `cd` to fail as well, propagating this error and running these commands far away from the intended directories.

Check `cd`s exit status and/or use subshells to limit the effects of `cd`.
