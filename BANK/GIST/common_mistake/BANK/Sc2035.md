# Use ./*.m3u so names with dashes won't become options.

### Problematic code:
    rm *

### Correct code:
    rm ./*

### Rationale

Since files and arguments are strings passed the same way, programs can't properly determine which is which, and rely on dashes to determine what's what.

A file named `-f` (`touch -- -f`) will not be deleted by the problematic code. It will instead be interpreted as a command line option, and `rm` will even report success. 

Using `./*` will instead cause the glob to be expanded into `./-f`, which no program will treat as an option.
