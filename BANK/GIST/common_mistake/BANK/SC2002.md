# Useless cat. Consider 'cmd < file | ..' or 'cmd file | ..' instead.

### Problematic code:

    cat file | tr ' ' _

### Correct code:

    tr ' ' _ < file

### Rationale:

`cat` is a tool for con"cat"enating files. Reading a single file as input to a program is considered a [Useless Use Of Cat (UUOC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat). 

It's more efficient and less roundabout to simply use redirection. This is especially true for programs that can benefit from seekable input, like `tail`. 

Many tools also accept optional filenames, e.g. `grep -q foo file` instead of `cat file | grep -q foo`.

### Contraindications

None.
