# Remove space after = if trying to assign a value (or for empty string, use var='' ... ).

### Problematic code:

    # I want programs to show text in dutch!
    LANGUAGE= nl

    # I want to run the nl command with English error messages!
    LANGUAGE= nl

### Correct code:

    # I want programs to show text in dutch!
    LANGUAGE=nl

    # I want to run the nl command with English error messages!
    LANGUAGE='' nl

### Rationale:

It's easy to think that `LANGUAGE= nl` would assign `"nl"` to the variable `LANGUAGE`. It doesn't.

Instead, it runs `nl` (the "number lines" command) and sets `LANGUAGE` to an empty string in its environment.

Since trying to assign values this way is a common mistake, ShellCheck warns about it and asks you to be explicit when assigning empty strings (except for `IFS`, due to the common `IFS= read ..` idiom). 

### Contraindications
If you're familiar with this behavior and feel that the explicit version is unnecessary, you can ignore the message. ``alias shellcheck=`shellcheck -e SC1007` ``
