## Bash doesn't support variables in brace range expansions.

### Problematic code:

    for i in {1..$n}
    do
      echo "$i"
    done

### Correct code:

    for ((i=0; i<n; i++))
    do
      echo "$i"
    done

### Rationale:

In Bash, brace expansion happens before variable expansion. This means that brace expansion will not account for variables.

For integers, use an arithmetic for loop instead. For zero-padded numbers or letters, use of eval may be warranted:

    from="a" to="m"
    for c in $(eval "echo {$from..$to}"); do echo "$c"; done

or more carefully (if `from`/`to` could be user input, or if the brace expansion could have spaces):

    from="a" to="m"
    while IFS= read -d '' -r c
    do
      echo "Read $c"
    done <  <(eval "printf '%s\0' $(printf "{%q..%q}.jpg" "$from" "$to")")
    

### Contraindications

None (if you're writing for e.g. zsh, make sure the shebang indicates this so shellcheck won't warn)
