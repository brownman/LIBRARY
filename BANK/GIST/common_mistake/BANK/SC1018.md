# This is a &amp;nbsp;. Delete it and retype as space.

You copy-pasted some code, probably from a blog or web site, which for formatting reasons contained unicode no-break spaces instead of regular spaces.

They look the same to humans, but not to shells.

If you have just a few, delete the space and retype it. If you have tons, do a search&replace in your editor (copy-paste an offending space into the search field, and type a regular space into the replace field), or use `sed -e $'s/\xC2\xA0/ /g' -i yourfile`.
