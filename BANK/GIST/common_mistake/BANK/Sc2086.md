#Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.

### Problematic code:
    echo $1

### Correct code:
    echo "$1"

### Rationale 
The problematic code looks like "print the first argument". It's actually "Split the first argument by spaces, tabs and line feeds. Expand each of them as if it was a glob. Join all the resulting strings and filenames with spaces. Print the result."

Quoting prevents word splitting and glob expansion, and prevents the script from breaking when input contains spaces, line feeds, glob characters and such.

### Contraindications
Sometimes you want to split on spaces, like when building a command line.

    options="-j 5 -B"
    make $options file

Just quoting this doesn't work. Instead, you should have used an array:

    options=(-j 5 -B)
    make "${options[@]}" file

To split on spaces but not perform glob expansion, Bash has a `set -f` to disable globbing.  You can disable word splitting by setting IFS="".
