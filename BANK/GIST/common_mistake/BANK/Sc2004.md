# $/${} is unnecessary on arithmetic variables.

### Problematic code:

    echo $(($n+1))

### Correct code:

    echo $((n+1))

### Rationale:

The `$` on regular variables in arithmetic contexts has no purpose, and is just noise. 

The `$` does matter for special variables like `$1` vs `1`, `$#` vs `#`. ShellCheck does not produce this style suggestion for these cases.
