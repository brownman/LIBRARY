# Did you forget to close this double quoted string?

### Problematic code:

    greeting="hello
    target="world"

### Correct code:

    greeting="hello"
    target="world"

### Rationale:

The first line is missing a quote. 

ShellCheck warns when it detects multi-line double quoted, single quoted or backticked strings when the character that follows it looks out of place. 

### Contraindications

If you do want a multiline variable, just make sure the character after it is a quote, space or line feed.

    var='multiline
    'value

can be rewritten for readability and to remove the warning:

    var='multiline
    value'

As always `` `..` `` should be rewritten to ``$(..)``.
