# Shell functions can't be passed to external commands.

### Problematic code:

    foo() { bar --baz "$@"; frob --baz "$@"; };
    find . -exec foo {} +

### Correct code:

    find . -exec sh -c 'bar --baz "$@"; frob --baz "$@";' -- {} +

### Rationale:

Shell functions are only known to the shell. External commands like `find`, `xargs`, `su` and `sudo` do not recognize shell functions. 

Instead, the function contents can be executed in a shell, either through `sh -c` or by creating a separate shell script as an executable file.

### Contraindications

If you're intentionally passing a word that happens to have the same name as a declared function, you can quote it to make shellcheck ignore it, e.g.

    nobody() {
      sudo -u "nobody" "$@"
    }
