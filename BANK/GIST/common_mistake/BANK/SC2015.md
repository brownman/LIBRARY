# Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true.

### Problematic code:

    [[ $dryrun ]] && echo "Would delete file" || rm file

### Correct code:

    if [[ $dryrun ]]
    then
      echo "Would delete file"
    else
      rm file
    fi

### Rationale:

It's common to use `A && B` to run `B` when `A` is true, and `A || C` to run `C` when `A` is false.

However, combining them into `A && B || C` is not the same as `if A then B else C`.

In this case, if `A` is true but `B` is false, `C` will run. 

For the code sample above, if the script was run with stdout closed for any reason (such as explicitly running `script --dryrun >&-`), echo would fail and the file would be deleted, even though `$dryrun` was set!

If an `if` clause is used instead, this problem is avoided.

### Contraindications
Ignore this warning when you actually do intend to run C when either A or B fails.
