# Named class needs outer [], e.g. [[:digit:]\].

### Problematic code:

    gzip file[:digit:]*.txt

### Correct code:

    gzip file[[:digit:]]*.txt

### Rationale:

Predefined character groups are supposed to be used inside character ranges. `[:digit:]` matches one of "digt:" just like `[abc]` matches one of "abc". `[[:digit:]]` matches a digit. 

### Contraindications

When passing an argument to `tr` which parses these by itself without relying on globbing, you should quote it instead, e.g. `tr -d '[:digit:]'`
