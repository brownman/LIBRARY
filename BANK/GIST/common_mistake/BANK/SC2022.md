# Note that unlike globs, o* here matches 'ooo' but not 'oscar'
### Problematic code:

    grep 'foo*'

when wanting to match `food` and `foosball`, but not `mofo` or `keyfob`. 

### Correct code:

    grep '^foo' 

### Rationale:

As a glob, `foo*` means "Any string starting with foo", e.g. `food` and `foosball`.

As a regular expression, "foo*" means "f followed by 1 or more o's, anywhere", e.g. "mofo" or "keyfob". 

This construct is way more common as a glob than as a regex, so ShellCheck notifies you about it.

### Contraindications

If you're aware of the above, you can ignore this message. If you'd like shellcheck to be quiet, use a [[directive]] or `'fo[o]*'`.
