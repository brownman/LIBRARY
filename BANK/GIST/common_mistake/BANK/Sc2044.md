## For loops over find output are fragile. Use find -exec or a while read loop.

It is difficult to correctly use "find" in a for loop, because filenames can contain bytes such as newlines and "*".  Where practical, consider using find's "-exec" like this:

    find . -exec COMMAND... {} \;
    find . -exec COMMAND... {} \+

A portable though complicated approach is to use a subshell (use '\'' for each single quote), though since a subshell is used, all variable assignments in the loop are lost after the loop ends:

    find . -exec sh -c '
     for file do
        ...  # Use "$file" not $file
     done' sh {} +


A nonstandard but widely-working simple alternative is:

    find . -print0 | xargs -0 COMMAND

Using a find... while loop is another alternative.  This requires nonstandard extensions to find (-print0) and shell (read -d), and fails in some cases on Cygwin (in while loops,  filenames ending in \r \n and \n look identical to Cygwin).  Variable values may be lost after the loop because the loop may run in a subshell:

    find . -print0 | while IFS="" read -r -d "" file ; do ...
      COMMAND "$file" # Use quoted "$file", not $file, everywhere.
    done
