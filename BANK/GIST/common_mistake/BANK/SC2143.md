## Instead of [ -n $(foo | grep bar) ], use  foo | grep -q bar .
### Problematic code:

    if [ "$(find . | grep 'IMG[0-9]')" ]
    then
      echo "Images found"
    fi

### Correct code:

    if find . | grep -q 'IMG[0-9]'
    then
      echo "Images found"
    fi

### Rationale:

The problematic code has to iterate the entire directory and read all matching lines into memory before making a decision. 

The correct code is cleaner and stops at the first matching line, avoiding both iterating the rest of the directory and reading data into memory.

### Contraindications

The `pipefail` bash option may interfere with this rewrite, since the `if` will now in effect be evaluating the statuses of all commands instead of just the last one. Be careful using them together.
