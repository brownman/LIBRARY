## You need spaces around the comparison operator.

### Problematic code:

    [[ 0=1 ]]

### Correct code:

    [[ 0 = 1 ]]

### Rationale:

`[[ 0 = 1 ]]` means "check if 0 and 1 are equal".
 
`[[ str ]]` is short form for `[[ -n str ]]`, and means "check if `str` is non-empty". It doesn't matter if `str` happens to contain `0=1`. 

Always use spaces around the comparison operator in `[..]` and `[[..]]`, otherwise it won't be recognized as an operator.

### Contraindications

None.
