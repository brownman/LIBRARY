# For command expansion, the tick should slant left (` vs ´).


### Problematic code:

    echo "Your username is ´whoami´"

### Correct code:

    echo "Your username is $(whoami)" # Preferred
    echo "Your username is `whoami`"  # Deprecated, will give [SC2006] 

### Rationale:

In some fonts it's hard to tell ticks apart, but Bash strongly distinguishes between backticks (grave accent `` ` ``), forward ticks (acute accent `´`) and regular ticks (apostrophe `'`). 

Backticks start command expansions, while forward ticks are literal. To help spot bugs, ShellCheck parses backticks and forward ticks interchangeably. 

### Contraindications

If you want to write out literal forward ticks, such as fancyful ascii quotation marks:

    echo "``Proprietary software is an injustice.´´  - Richard Stallman"

use single quotes instead:

    echo '``Proprietary software is an injustice.´´  - Richard Stallman'

To nest forward ticks in command expansion, use `$(..)` instead of `` `..` ``.
