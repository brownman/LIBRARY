##  Include a shebang (#!) to specify the shell.

### Problematic code:

    echo "Hello World"

### Correct code:

    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hello World"

### Rationale:

ShellCheck noticed that your file does not start with a shebang. Shebangs are good for a number of reasons:

* They allow scripts to be executed outside of interactive prompts.
* They ensure the script is executed by the correct shell.
* Editors and utilities (including shellcheck) use it to determine the file type.

### Contraindications
