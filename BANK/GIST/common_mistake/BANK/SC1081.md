## Scripts are case sensitive. Use 'if', not 'If'.

### Problematic code:

    If true
    Then 
      echo "hello"
    Fi

### Correct code:

    if true
    then
      echo "hello"
    fi

### Rationale:

Shells are case sensitive and do not accept `If` or `IF` in place of lowercase `if`.

### Contraindications

If you're aware of this and insist on naming a function `WHILE`, you can quote the name to prevent shellcheck from thinking you meant `while`.
