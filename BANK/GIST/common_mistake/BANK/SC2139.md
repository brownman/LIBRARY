## This expands when defined, not when used. Consider escaping.

### Problematic code:

    alias whereami="echo $PWD"

### Correct code:

    alias whereami='echo $PWD'

### Rationale:

With double quotes, this particular alias will be defined as `echo /home/me`, so it will always print the same path. This is rarely intended.

By using single quotes or escaping any expansions, we define the alias as `echo $PWD`, which will be expanded when we use the alias. This is the far more common use case.

### Contraindications

If you don't mind that your alias definition is expanded at define time, you can ignore this warning.
