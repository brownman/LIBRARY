#  This does a backup from the host computer to a locally connected
#+ firewire HDD using rsync and ssh.
#  (Script should work with USB-connected device (see lines 40-43).
#  It then rotates the backups.
#  Run it via cron every night at 5am.
#  This only backs up the home directory.
#  If ownerships (other than the user's) should be preserved,
#+ then run the rsync process as root (and re-instate the -o).
#  We save every day for 7 days, then every week for 4 weeks,
#+ then every month for 3 months.

#  See: http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/
#+ for more explanation of the theory.
#  Save as: $HOME/bin/nightly-backup_firewire-hdd.sh

#  Known bugs:
#  ----------
#  i)  Ideally, we want to exclude ~/.tmp and the browser caches.

#  ii) If the user is sitting at the computer at 5am,
#+     and files are modified while the rsync is occurring,
#+     then the BACKUP_JUSTINCASE branch gets triggered.
#      To some extent, this is a 
#+     feature, but it also causes a "disk-space leak".
