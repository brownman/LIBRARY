#  The scores should distribute fairly evenly, assuming RANDOM is fairly random.
#  With $MAXTHROWS at 600, all should cluster around 100, plus-or-minus 20 or so.
#
#  Keep in mind that RANDOM is a pseudorandom generator,
#+ and not a spectacularly good one at that.

#  Randomness is a deep and complex subject.
#  Sufficiently long "random" sequences may exhibit
#+ chaotic and other "non-random" behavior.

# Exercise (easy):
# ---------------
# Rewrite this script to flip a coin 1000 times.
# Choices are "HEADS" and "TAILS."
