# dialog.sh: Using 'gdialog' widgets.

# Must have 'gdialog' installed on your system to run this script.
# Or, you can replace all instance of 'gdialog' below with 'kdialog' ...
# Version 1.1 (corrected 04/05/05)

# This script was inspired by the following article.
#     "Scripting for X Productivity," by Marco Fioretti,
#      LINUX JOURNAL, Issue 113, September 2003, pp. 86-9.
# Thank you, all you good people at LJ.

# Now, we'll retrieve and display the saved variable.
. $OUTFILE   # 'Source' the saved file.
echo "The variable input in the \"input box\" was: "$VARIABLE""


rm $OUTFILE  # Clean up by removing the temp file.
             # Some applications may need to retain this file.

exit $?

# Exercise: Rewrite this script using the 'zenity' widget set.
