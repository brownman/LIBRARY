# Script to perform batch anonymous ftp. Essentially converts a list of
# of command-line arguments into input to ftp.
# ==> This script is nothing but a shell wrapper around "ftp" . . .
# Simple, and quick - written as a companion to ftplist 
# -h specifies the remote host (default prep.ai.mit.edu) 
# -d specifies the remote directory to cd to - you can provide a sequence 
# of -d options - they will be cd'ed to in turn. If the paths are relative, 
# make sure you get the sequence right. Be careful with relative paths - 
# there are far too many symlinks nowadays.  
# (default is the ftp login directory)
# -v turns on the verbose option of ftp, and shows all responses from the 
# ftp server.  
# -f remotefile[:localfile] gets the remote file into localfile 
# -m pattern does an mget with the specified pattern. Remember to quote 
# shell characters.  
# -c does a local cd to the specified directory
# For example, 
# 	ftpget -h expo.lcs.mit.edu -d contrib -f xplaces.shar:xplaces.sh \
#		-d ../pub/R3/fixes -c ~/fixes -m 'fix*' 
# will get xplaces.shar from ~ftp/contrib on expo.lcs.mit.edu, and put it
# in xplaces.sh in the current working directory, and get all fixes from
# ~ftp/pub/R3/fixes and put them in the ~/fixes directory. 
# Obviously, the sequence of the options is important, since the equivalent
# commands are executed by ftp in corresponding order
