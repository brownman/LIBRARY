# gen0
#
# This is an example "generation 0" start-up file for "life.sh".
# --------------------------------------------------------------
#  The "gen0" file is a 10 x 10 grid using a period (.) for live cells,
#+ and an underscore (_) for dead ones. We cannot simply use spaces
#+ for dead cells in this file because of a peculiarity in Bash arrays.
#  [Exercise for the reader: explain this.]
#
# Lines beginning with a '#' are comments, and the script ignores them.
