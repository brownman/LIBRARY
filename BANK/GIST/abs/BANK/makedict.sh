# Original script copyright 1993, by Alec Muffett.

#  This modified script included in this document in a manner

#+ that the original script is a part of.

#  This script processes text files to produce a sorted list
#+ of words found in the files.
#  This may be useful for compiling dictionaries
#+ and for other lexicographic purposes.
