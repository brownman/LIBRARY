# ==> Script for mounting and installing pen/keychain USB storage devices.
# ==> Runs as root at system startup (see below).
# ==>
# ==> Newer Linux distros (2004 or later) autodetect
# ==> and install USB pen drives, and therefore don't need this script.
# ==> But, it's still instructive.

#  Some code lifted from usb-mount by Michael Hamilton's usb-mount (LGPL)
#+ see http://users.actrix.co.nz/michael/usbmount.html
#
#  INSTALL
#  -------
#  Put this in /etc/hotplug/usb/diskonkey.
#  Then look in /etc/hotplug/usb.distmap, and copy all usb-storage entries
#+ into /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap, substituting "usb-storage" for "diskonkey".
#  Otherwise this code is only run during the kernel module invocation/removal
#+ (at least in my tests), which defeats the purpose.
#
#  TODO
#  ----
#  Handle more than one diskonkey device at one time (e.g. /dev/diskonkey1
#+ and /mnt/diskonkey1), etc. The biggest problem here is the handling in
#+ devlabel, which I haven't yet tried.
