# Definition: A "magic square" is a two-dimensional array
#             of integers in which all the rows, columns,
#             and *long* diagonals add up to the same number.
#             Being "square," the array has the same number
#             of rows and columns.
# An example of a magic square of order 3 is:
#   8  1  6   
#   3  5  7   
#   4  9  2   
# All the rows, columns, and long diagonals add up to 15.

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Add a function to calculate the sum of each row, column,
#    and *long* diagonal. The sums must match.
#    This is the "magic constant" of that particular order square.
# 2) Have the print_square function auto-calculate how much space
#    to allot between square elements for optimized display.
#    This might require parameterizing the "printf" line.
# 3) Add appropriate functions for generating magic squares
#    with an *even* number of rows/columns.
#    This is non-trivial(!).
#    See the URL for Kwon Young Shin, above, for help.
